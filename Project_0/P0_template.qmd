from lets_plot import *

LetsPlot.setup_html(isolated_frame=True)
```


```{python}
# Learn morea about Code Cells: https://quarto.org/docs/reference/cells/cells-jupyter.html

# Include and execute your code here
from palmerpenguins import load_penguins
df = load_penguins()
```

## QUESTION|TASK 1

__Include the tables created from [PY4DS: CH2 Data Visualization](https://aeturrell.github.io/python4DS/data-visualise.html) used to create the above chart (Hint: copy the code from 2.2.1. The penguins data frame and paste each in the cells below)__


```{python}

penguins = load_penguins()
penguins


```

_include figures in chunks and discuss your findings in the figure._

```{python}

penguins.head()

# To see the end of the penguins
# penguins.tail()
#Shows a small chart of info for penguins
# penguins.info()

```


## QUESTION|TASK 2

__Recreate the example charts from [PY4DS: CH2 Data Visualization](https://aeturrell.github.io/python4DS/data-visualise.html) of the textbook. (Hint: copy the chart code from 2.2.3. Creating a Plot, one for each cell below)__


```{python}
(
ggplot(
  data = penguins,
  mapping = aes(x = "flipper_length_mm", y = "body_mass_g" )
  ) 
  # Add this into ggplot at the end of mapping to get the entire line: color = "species"
  + 
  geom_point(
    mapping = aes(color = "species")
  ) + 
  #smooth adds a line to the graph
  geom_smooth(type = "lm")

#Lowers the transparency of the dots
  #aes(alpha = '#')
)

```

_include figures in chunks and discuss your findings in the figure._

```{python}

(
    ggplot(data=penguins, mapping=aes(x="flipper_length_mm", y="body_mass_g"))
    + geom_point()
)


```


```{python}
(
    ggplot(
        data=penguins,
        mapping=aes(x="flipper_length_mm", y="body_mass_g", color="species"),
    )
    + geom_point()
)


```

Exercises:
#1. How many rows are in penguins?
```{python}
# Include and execute your code here
penguins

```

#2. What does the bill_depth_mm variable in the penguins data frame describe?
```{python}
# Include and execute your code here


```
